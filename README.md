Did you ever want to make your own video game?  I did, and this is the first step of many. I will do my best to make it a series of tutorials while relating my experience.

Tutorials / Docs for each step :
1. [Simple Console Game](tutorials/tutorial-01-console.md)
2. [Adding SDL support](tutorials/tutorial-02-addingSDL.md)
3. [Using SDL for rendering and mouse click](tutorials/tutorial-03-rendering-ttt.md)
